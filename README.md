  <h2>Titanic Prediction Model</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a prediction model that utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset used in this project includes information about the passengers, such as their age, gender, class, fare and more. The model will use this information to predict the survival rate of the passengers.

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Seaborn</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to use</h2>
  <p>
    The code can be run using any Python IDE. The main file for this project is "titanic_disaster.py". To run the code, simply open the file in your Python IDE and run it. The code will load the dataset and perform the necessary preprocessing steps, such as cleaning the data and handling missing values. The code will then train the logistic regression model using the training data and evaluate its performance using the test data. The final result will be displayed in the form of a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project provides a basic introduction to logistic regression and its application in the field of machine learning. The prediction model created in this project can be used as a starting point for further exploration and improvement. The dataset used in this project is just one of many that can be used to create a prediction model, and the code can be easily modified to use a different dataset or a different machine learning algorithm.
